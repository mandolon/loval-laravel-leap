# Tauri Auto-Update Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED SETUP

All components of the Tauri auto-update system have been successfully implemented for **loval-laravel-leap**.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Signing Key Pair Generation** ✓
- Generated cryptographic keys for secure app signing
- Private key: `~/.tauri/key.txt` (encrypted with password)
- Public key: `~/.tauri/key.txt.pub`
- Used for signing binaries and verifying updates

### 2. **Configuration Updated** ✓
**File**: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

```json
"plugins": {
  "updater": {
    "active": true,
    "endpoints": [
      "https://github.com/mandolon/loval-laravel-leap/releases/download/latest/latest.json"
    ],
    "dialog": true,
    "pubkey": "dW50cnVzdGVkIGNvbW1lbnQ6IG1pbmlzaWduIHB1YmxpYyBrZXk6IDRCNTRFRURFNDU1QUEwNzAKUldSd29GcEZ6dTFVUzJ5YnhZcklhVGpMSEZHQnVNbXVDaitwSk1DVyt3aXJIMG41OTRXTW1jWlVtCg=="
  }
}
```

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Verified** ✓
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

The existing workflow is pre-configured to:
- Build app for macOS (universal), Ubuntu, and Windows
- Sign binaries with private key
- Upload artifacts to GitHub releases
- Create `latest.json` for update checking
- Supports environment variables for signing

### 4. **Documentation Created** ✓

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TAURI_AUTOUPDATE_SETUP.md` | Complete setup guide with security info |
| `TAURI_AUTOUPDATE_QUICK_REF.md` | Quick reference for common tasks |
| `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` | Step-by-step GitHub Secrets configuration |

    ↓
New Version Available?
    ↓ YES
    ↓
Show Update Dialog
    ↓
User Clicks "Update"
    ↓
Download Signed Binary
    ↓
Verify Signature (using public key)
    ↓
Install & Restart
    ↓
User Has New Version ✨
```

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Cryptographic Signing**
- Binaries are signed with your private key
- Users verify with public key from config
- Prevents tampering or malicious updates

✅ **Encrypted Private Key**
- Protected by password you set
- GitHub Secrets management
- Never exposed in logs

✅ **Automatic Verification**
- Signature checked before installation
- Invalid signatures rejected
- Users notified of security status

---

## ⚡ Next Steps (Action Required)

### 1. Add GitHub Secrets
**Time**: 5 minutes

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Create `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`: 
   ```bash
   cat ~/.tauri/key.txt
   ```
3. Create `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`: Enter your password

See `GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed steps.

### 2. Create First Release
**Time**: 10-15 minutes (first build takes longer)

```bash
# Update version number
# src-tauri/tauri.conf.json → "version": "1.0.1"

# Create git tag
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Build for all platforms
# - Sign the binaries
# - Create release on GitHub
# - Generate latest.json
```

### 3. Monitor Workflow
- Go to GitHub → Actions
- Watch the build process
- Verify artifacts are signed
- Check for any errors

### 4. Test in Application
- Run the application
- It will check for updates automatically
- New version should be offered
- Update should install successfully

## 🔑 Important Security Info

### Store These Safely
```
~/.tauri/key.txt               Keep this SECRET and BACKED UP
~/.tauri/key.txt.pub           Can be shared (public)
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD  In GitHub Secrets only
```

### Recovery Plan
- ✅ Back up private key to encrypted drive
- ✅ Store password in password manager
- ✅ Document recovery procedure
- ⚠️ If lost, you cannot sign future updates!

## ✨ What Users Experience

When a new version is released:

1. **Automatic Check**: App checks for updates on startup
2. **Clear Dialog**: User sees version info and release notes
3. **Safe Download**: Signed binary is verified
4. **Seamless Install**: Update applies, app restarts with new version
5. **No Manual Steps**: No download links or complex instructions needed

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Q: Workflow fails with "signature verification failed"**
- Check GitHub Secrets are set correctly
- Verify private key is complete (includes BEGIN/END lines)

**Q: Update endpoint not found**
- Ensure release is published (not draft)
- Check GitHub Actions completed successfully
- Verify latest.json exists in release assets

**Q: Need to regenerate keys**
```bash
npx tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/key.txt
# Update TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY in GitHub Secrets
# Update pubkey in tauri.conf.json
```
